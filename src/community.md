# Community

We are very open to the open source community. If you are interested in the
MesaLock Linux project, please find us on the `#mesalock-linux` or
`#mesalock-linux-cn` (in Chinese) IRC channels at the [freenode
server](irc://chat.freenode.net) and the bridged room on Matrix. If you're not
familiar with IRC, we recommend chatting through [Matrix via
Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mesalock-linux:matrix.org) or via the [Kiwi
web IRC client](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mozilla.org/#mesalock-linux).
